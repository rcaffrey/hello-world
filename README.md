first repo

Hello everyone,

I'm just getting back into learning code.  It has been over a decade since I finished college, and have had nearly zero experience in coding as I've been a network admin for most of that time.

I'm currently now working for a different company as a contractor and the project I'm on is going to be quite complex and require more development than was expected.  Instead of abandoning the project, feeling under-qualified to complete it, I'm going to give it a try and who knows... may open up a whole new career path for me!
